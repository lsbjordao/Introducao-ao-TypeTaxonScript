  abstract = {This paper describes object-oriented programming (OOP) in terms relevant to the modeling of biological systems. Object-oriented programming is not a new technique but remains mostly unexploited in biosystems modeling. For biological scientists, the ideas of object-oriented design, based on the notions of taxonomy, discrete structures, behavior, and scale, make the approach intrinsically familiar and thus inherently compelling. We present a new OOP framework that may serve as a generic foundation for the production of plant models. This OOP framework represents a first step towards the development of generic model architectures and provides modularity, mechanistic richness, and advantages in process evaluation previously unavailable.}

  abstract = {Taxonomists’ efforts throughout history provide significant amount of data that give support for establishing the specific identity of several groups of biological systems. In addition to identifying species, taxonomic research offers a wide range of biological information that can be used in other disciplines, e.g. evolution, ecology, integrated pest management. However, most of this information remains unappreciated due to certain aspects: (1) the advent of analytical tools have led to a shift in interest and investment in researches, focusing mainly in molecular studies; (2) the erroneous concept that the extensive data offered by taxonomic studies can be replaced by other datasets, separating it from its hypothesis-driven and investigative nature; (3) the final products found in taxonomic works are commonly restricted to a small group of researchers, due to its low accessibility and specific language. Considering this last aspect, web-based tools can be valuable to simplify the dissemination of the taxonomic product. Semantic annotation provide a condition in which species descriptions can be readily available and be far more extensive, enabling rapid exchange of countless data related to biological systems.}
